## Goal

Two badges on two transceivers, one server. User 1 taps and says
**"captain to engineering"** → that utterance (the caller's actual voice) plays
on badge 2 immediately → if user 2 taps within **30 s**, a **persistent
bidirectional audio channel** opens (as close to realtime as possible, no taps
needed while open) → either side closes it with a gesture.

On completion, the learnings port to `relay-linux/`, `relay-mobile/`, and
`maincomputer/` (separate effort, discussed before execution).

## Test Bench (validated 2026-07-04)

| Role | Host | Badge |
|---|---|---|
| Transceiver 1 | PAN | COMBADGE 1 `2C:F2:DF:45:EC:28` |
| Transceiver 2 | BOX | COMBADGE 2 `1B:B8:82:88:2F:60` |
| Server (computer.py) | CUBE | — |

- Both transceivers validated end-to-end against single-threaded computer.py
  ("computer time" round-trip from each badge). BOX's documented RTL8761B SCO
  suspension did **not** reproduce — treat that history as stale pending longer use.
- BOX launches via `sdk/transceiver.sh` (inline `sudo SDK_SERVER_HOST=cube ...` —
  plain `export` does not survive sudo's env reset).
- BOX has a severed `/c/tos` — **re-run sync.sh after every SDK code change**, then
  restart its transceiver. PAN sees CUBE's files live over sshfs (restart only).
- Server port: default 1701. If maincomputer is running on CUBE, launch the SDK
  server with `SDK_SERVER_PORT=1702` (and matching env on both transceivers).

## Locked Decisions

1. **SDK-only first.** PAN + BOX as transceivers 1 and 2. Mobile app joins only
   after the SDK phases complete. `multiuser/` is a scratchpad, not a spec.
2. **Tap socket becomes the channel.** The caller's tap connection and the
   callee's answer-tap connection each go full-duplex after channel-open. No
   new connections mid-flow; close = socket close.
3. **Alias directory is flat: alias → MAC, many-to-one.** Person, role, and
   location aliases are all just strings resolving to a badge
   (`sdk/aliases.conf`, reloaded per tap, collision-checked). "Knepfler to
   Chief Engineer" and "captain to engineering" are the same mechanism.
4. **Hail is store-and-forward.** Caller's utterance is buffered from tap
   start, finalized on silence, then delivered whole to the target badge.
   (Live streaming of the hail tail is a possible later refinement; the
   target's ~1 s cold-SCO spin-up would clip a live stream's opening anyway.)
5. **Valid hails are defined by construction.** Matching only accepts
   `"<self-alias> to <target-alias>"` where self-alias belongs to the tapping
   badge and target-alias to a *different* badge. No self-hails.
6. **Close gestures may differ per platform** (precedent: mobile gesture-free
   finalize). Linux: double-tap (btmon `AT+BVRA=1`) or just the socket
   closing. Mobile (later): any tap during SCO is a system hang-up that drops
   SCO — adopted as the close gesture, not fought.

## Protocol (SDK dialect — converging with maincomputer's)

Every connection opens with an 18-byte handshake: **1 tap-type byte + 17-byte
ASCII MAC** (colon-separated, uppercase). Legacy MAC-less clients fall back to
sentinel `00:00:00:00:00:00`.

| Byte | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `b'1'`+MAC | relay → server | Tap session: WAV header + PCM stream follows |
| `b'h'`+MAC | relay → server | *(Phase 2)* Register persistent downlink; held open |
| `b'c'` | server → relay | Command matched — play ack chirp |
| `b'f'` | server → relay | No match / failure — play nack chirp |
| `b'v'`+size+WAV | server → relay | Voice response (4-byte BE size). On the downlink: unsolicited playback (hail delivery) |
| `b'k'` | server → relay | Keepalive — reset recv timeout, keep waiting |
| `b'W'` | server → relay | Prewarm (downlink): a hail is being captured for this badge — bring SCO up now and hold it (≤`PREWARM_MAX_S` 25 s, `audio_lock` held) so the coming `b'v'` plays instantly. Best-effort: expiry/failure falls back to the cold path |
| `b'O'` | server → relay | Channel open — this tap socket is now the live intercom: uplink stays raw mic PCM; downlink switches to framed audio |
| `b'A'`+len+PCM | server → relay | Channel audio frame (2-byte BE len) — peer's amplified mic audio; relay pipes payload into its stdin player |
| `b'X'` | server → relay | Channel closed by the other side — play close chirp, teardown |

Close-with-drain discipline (already in place): server drains inbound PCM to
EOF before closing (avoids TCP RST truncating in-flight `b'v'` payloads);
relay half-closes (`SHUT_WR`) the moment it has the signal byte.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Concurrency + badge identity ✓ (2026-07-04)
- [x] 18-byte handshake (`b'1'`+MAC) in listener.py and computer.py
      (legacy/MAC-less fallback to sentinel).
- [x] Thread-per-connection server: shared Vosk `Model`, per-connection
      `KaldiRecognizer`, `listen(8)`, per-connection drain+close in thread.
- [x] Badge registry `{MAC: addr, last_seen}` under a lock; per-MAC log lines
      (including which MAC each voice response was sent to).
- [x] Validated 2026-07-04: "computer time" from PAN and BOX badges, including
      near-simultaneous independent sessions. Canonical `sdk/transceiver.sh`
      added (`sudo SDK_SERVER_HOST=cube python transceiver.py`).

### Phase 2 — Persistent downlink + unsolicited push ✓ code complete (2026-07-04)
- [x] listener.py: `b'h'`+MAC downlink opened at startup on a background
      thread, held open forever (replaces probe_server, which is removed);
      15 s keepalive timeout → reconnect every 5 s, replaying
      maincomputeronline.wav on each (re)connect (audible restart detection).
      Pushed `b'v'` frames play via cold-SCO sequence (ensure_hfp_profile →
      play_wav_cold → teardown). `audio_lock` serializes tap cycles vs
      pushed audio.
- [x] computer.py: downlink registry `{MAC: {sock, lock, addr}}`; `b'k'`
      keepalive every 5 s (recv-timeout cadence); per-entry send lock
      (single-writer — keepalive can't interleave into a `b'v'` frame);
      reconnect replaces stale entry safely; cleanup on EOF/error.
- [x] Server console (stdin thread): `badges` lists registry + downlink
      status; `hail <mac-substring> [text]` pushes TTS to that badge.
- [x] Wire-level smoke test passed (2026-07-04): fake downlink client on a
      test port — registration, keepalive, console hail → full `b'v'`+WAV
      frame delivered intact.
- [x] On-badge validation (2026-07-04): both downlinks UP in `badges`;
      `hail 2F:60 ...` played on idle COMBADGE 2 (86 KB frame). (Server
      restart re-announce not yet explicitly exercised — expected to fall
      out of normal use; verify opportunistically.)

### Phase 3 — Hail flow ✓ code complete (2026-07-04)
- [x] `sdk/aliases.conf` (MAC → comma-separated aliases), per-tap reload,
      collision check. **First alias = the badge's spoken name** (used in
      responses about it) — hence the name-first ordering convention.
      Seeded: `captain, bridge` / `chief engineer, engineering`.
- [x] Tap PCM buffered from stream start; `"<self> to <target>"` matched in
      real-time (cross-product, longest-first) with a final-text late catch;
      silence-finalize (`SDK_HAIL_SILENCE_S`, 1.5 s; 20 s hard cap); whole
      utterance WAV-framed and pushed to the target downlink. Server sends
      `b'k'` every ~4 s during capture and hold; **listener.py now treats
      `b'k'` as non-terminal and slides its recording deadline** (mirrors
      the full relay).
- [x] Pending-hail state (target → caller + answered-Event, `SDK_HAIL_ANSWER_S`,
      30 s). Caller's tap socket held open (keepalives + mic drain).
      **Answer-tap brought forward from Phase 4:** a tap from a badge with a
      pending hail is consumed as the answer — Phase 3 placeholder sends
      `b'c'` to the answerer and "X acknowledges." to the caller; Phase 4
      replaces this with the `b'O'` channel-open.
- [x] Failure responses via `b'v'` TTS: "There is no listing for X." (final
      text only — partials would false-positive) / "X is not available."
      (no downlink) / "There is no response from X." (window expiry).
- [x] Wire-level test passed (2026-07-04): SAPI-synthesized "captain to
      engineering status report" streamed as the caller — hail recognized,
      silence-finalized, delivered to fake target downlink; no-answer expiry
      and answered-tap scenarios both verified.
- [x] On-badge validation (2026-07-04): hail delivery, answer tap, and
      expiry all confirmed PAN↔BOX. Findings: (a) delivered hails played at
      ~20% loudness — badge-mic SCO capture is inherently low-amplitude vs
      near-full-scale TTS/chirps; fixed server-side with `normalize_pcm()`
      (peak-normalize to ~90% FS, 20× gain cap) — **re-verify loudness**.
      (b) "captain to sickbay" failed — root cause was NOT recognition but
      a **segment-discard bug**: Vosk finalizes a segment at each pause, and
      only the latest segment was kept, so speech followed by silence
      vanished before the final checks (FinalResult() flushes only the last
      — silent — segment, heard as 'huh'). Fixed: all finalized segments
      are banked and joined for both real-time matching (cross-boundary
      phrases now match) and the final checks; unknown-name remainder
      capped at 4 words so trailing noise ('huh') can't ride into the
      spoken response. Wire-regression: full Phase 3 suite + new
      "captain to sick bay" → "no listing" test, all passing.

### Phase 4 — Channel bridge ✓ code complete (2026-07-05)
- [x] Answer tap → `run_channel_answer` / caller thread → `run_channel_bridge`:
      `b'O'` to both tap sockets, then each connection thread pumps ONE
      direction (single writer per socket; per-conn send locks serialize the
      `b'X'`). Server→relay audio framed `b'A'`+2-byte len+PCM (control bytes
      stay distinguishable); relay→server stays raw. Per-chunk software gain
      `SDK_CHANNEL_GAIN` (default 12×, clip-guarded, odd-byte carry preserves
      sample alignment) — same SCO-mic-level story as hail normalization.
- [x] Relay `run_channel()`: ffmpeg uplink continues; downlink frames piped
      into long-running `pw-cat -p … -` (stdin); `b'X'`/EOF ends the channel;
      ACK chirp plays as close confirmation on both ends; normal teardown after.
- [x] **Close gesture = SINGLE tap while channel open** (fresh evdev fd, 1 s
      grace) → SHUT_WR → server closes bridge → `b'X'` both sides.
      **Deviation from original double-tap spec, flagged to Captain:**
      double-tap emits AT+BVRA, visible only via btmon/root (out of SDK
      scope), and mobile can't gesture during SCO at all — single-tap-close
      unifies with mobile's future tap=hang-up. Double-tap close can return
      in the full-relay port where btmon exists.
- [x] Wire test passed (2026-07-05): hail → answer tap → `b'O'` both sides →
      duplex PCM bridged with 12× gain verified in both directions →
      caller tap-close → `b'X'` delivered to both.
- [x] **On-badge VALIDATED (2026-07-05, Captain: "working perfectly"):**
      full loop — hail → answer tap → duplex conversation (paplay player,
      avg-magnitude noise gate, silent idle) → double-tap close from either
      badge. Volume ladder settled: chirps + tap-cycle TTS 0.5 ·
      pushed hails `SDK_PUSH_VOLUME` 1.0 (matches channel) · startup
      announces 0.5 · BOX ALSA MASTER raised 40%→100% (host-level, outside
      SDK). Tuning knobs live: `SDK_CHANNEL_GAIN` (12), `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE`
      (250 avg, 5 s stats log), `SDK_HAIL_SILENCE_S`, `SDK_HAIL_ANSWER_S`,
      `SDK_PUSH_VOLUME`.

### Phase 5 — Port learnings ✓ COMPLETE, ON-BADGE VALIDATED (2026-07-07)

**Captain confirmed all four validation tests successful (2026-07-07):**
greetings + dual voice-print auth, console hails to both badges, full hail →
answer → duplex conversation → close from either side, PAN (EC:28, Captain/
bridge) ↔ S21 (2F:60, Chief Engineer/engineering). The production intercom is
working and demonstrable. Findings: 2F:60's audio is slightly BETTER via the
S21 than it was on BOX — so BOX contributed some of the glitchiness, but the
badge itself is still suspected marginal; **Captain plans to buy a replacement
badge** (when it arrives: pair to the host, update its MAC in TOS.conf
`[intercom]` badge_* key + the relay host's `authorized_badges`/app config).
Tuning applied on hardware: TOS.conf `[relay] prime_ms_listening` 0 → 250
(Captain, by ear). The SDK's counterpart is the module constant
`PRIME_MS_LISTENING` in `listener.py`, which had sat at 0 for two months — the
tuning had travelled one way only.

⚠ **The SDK's value is 160, not 250, and the difference is not an oversight.**
What protects the chirp is the total silence at the head of the stream: the
prime PLUS the chirp file's own lead-in. The two projects play different chirps
— TOS's is 309 ms and starts at full level; the SDK's is 671 ms and opens with
90 ms of silence. 160 + 90 gives the same 250 ms of protection, and copying 250
would add 90 ms of dead air to every tap. Confirmed by blind A/B on PAN
(12 trials): 0 ms clipped 4/4, 160 ms and 250 ms clean 4/4 each.

Ported to production per Captain's rulings (2026-07-05/06): (1) unified b'h' —
the hello connection IS the downlink, legacy clients that close after the
greeting coexist; (2) auth-gated — no hail while the session is locked, and an
answer tap from a locked badge falls through to the voice-print prompt with the
hail left pending; (3) close gestures per platform — double-tap on Linux (via
the relay's existing btmon plumbing), SINGLE tap on mobile (the system's
tap-equals-SCO-hang-up is adopted as the gesture; Bixby owns double-tap);
(4) latency reductions in scope — the SDK's `PRIME_MS_LISTENING` 0 carried into
TOS.conf as `prime_ms_listening` 0, 0.2s sink poll, no post-cycle debounce
blackout. (TOS later moved to 250 and the SDK to 160 — the same protection through
different chirp assets; see the hardware-tuning note above.)

- [x] **maincomputer**: new `maincomputer/intercom.py` (downlink registry,
      hail flow with large-vocab silence gating, prepare_hail_pcm, prewarm,
      channel bridge with gate+gain, console badges/hail/close). Aliases +
      knobs in TOS.conf `[intercom]` (NOT a separate conf). Hail phrases ride
      the constrained per-tap grammar; "<self> to" markers give unknown-station
      hails a spoken "no listing" response. Wire-tested end-to-end 2026-07-06
      (12/14 pass; 2 fails were harness stdout-buffering artifacts, behaviors
      confirmed in the server log).
- [x] **relay-linux/**: downlink_loop replaces send_hello (reconnect
      greeting = restart detection, closes the RELAY.md open item), b'W'
      prewarm, pushed b'v' (push_volume/prime_ms_push), run_channel (paplay
      primary, double-tap close via stop_recording, ffmpeg-EOF close), SDK
      tap ordering (ffmpeg→header→chirp→connect). Compile-checked; on-badge
      validation pending PAN relay restart.
- [x] **relay-mobile**: downlink thread replaces the 3s liveness poll
      (keepalive silence = offline announce; reconnect = re-hello), prewarm =
      early SCO acquire under audioLock, pushed hails at 1.0, channel mode
      (streaming AudioTrack + capture-deadline extension), single-tap close =
      SCO-drop detection. APK built + installed on S21 2026-07-06; on-device
      validation pending.

Test bench changes for the production topology: COMBADGE 2 (2F:60) moves from
BOX to the **S21** (Chief Engineer / engineering) to isolate the badge-glitch
variable from BOX hardware; PAN keeps EC:28 (Captain / bridge).

### Phase 6 — Channel audio quality tuning ✓ ON-BADGE VALIDATED (2026-07-17)

**Symptoms observed during a longer on-badge intercom session (Captain):**
1. Choppy peer audio in chunks of ~1 second (test source: badge held near a
   TV speaker playing dialogue). No particular rhythm.
2. After each transmission, ~1 s of static as the receiving badge's speaker
   output leaked into its own mic and re-transmitted back to the sender.
3. Roughly 1 in 5 words clipped at the start on quiet-onset syllables.

Diagnosis from the `channel gate: open N/M chunks, last avg X` log: the
single-threshold gate flapped whenever avg hovered near 250 — a TV speaker
picked up at distance is exactly that signal. Adjacent 5 s windows during
the same test alternated between 42/42 open at avg 271 and 0/42 open at
avg 4. Receiver logs showed `dropped 0KB` throughout, so playback
back-pressure was ruled out.

**Fixes (SDK + production `maincomputer/intercom.py` + `TOS.conf`):**

1. **Hysteretic noise gate** replaces the single-threshold flap. Gate
   opens at `channel_gate` (default lowered 250 → 40) and stays open
   until avg drops below `channel_gate_close` (auto-derived = 40% of
   open) for `channel_gate_hold_s` (default 0.8 s). Marginal signals
   that hovered near the old 250 threshold no longer chop into
   second-long windows — they either open the gate and stay open, or
   fail to open at all. New knobs: `channel_gate_close`,
   `channel_gate_hold_s`, `channel_gate_fade_ms`. Log line reformatted:
   `channel gate: open N/M chunks, hd-muted K, last avg X (open ≥Y, close <Z)`.
2. **Boundary fade** — 10 ms linear fade at every gate open/close and
   every half-duplex release edge, kills the click a hard silence↔audio
   boundary would produce.
3. **Half-duplex mode** (`channel_half_duplex_ms`, default 800):
   whenever the local badge's speaker was fed peer audio within the
   last N ms, its mic uplink is force-silenced regardless of gate
   state. The feedback path is broken structurally — no more
   speaker-into-mic echo. Canonical comms behavior; users say
   "over". Whoever grabs the floor first keeps it until 800 ms after
   their last audio-carrying chunk. Both `_pump_audio` threads share a
   two-slot `entry["speaker_last_audio"]` dict; each pump writes its
   peer's slot on emit and reads its own slot on the next emit
   decision. Set to 0 to restore full duplex.
4. `channel_gain` lowered 12 → 6 alongside the gate drop: passing more
   borderline audio and amplifying less keeps the SCO noise floor
   inaudible without clipping soft speech.
5. **Floor control** (`channel_floor_release_ms`, default 1000; added
   2026-07-19 for same-room / filming use): one talker at a time. The
   first gate to open claims the floor (shared `entry["floor"]` dict);
   the peer's uplink is hard-muted for the entire hold, and on the
   holder's gate close the floor releases into a guard window during
   which BOTH uplinks stay muted. Rationale: half-duplex (item 3) mutes
   the *listener's* mic, but with two badges physically adjacent the
   peer-speaker bleed enters the **talker's** own open mic and
   round-trips as a feedback loop — the release guard outlasts the
   round-trip so the tail echo dies instead of grabbing a gate.
   `channel_floor_max_s` (default 12) force-releases a floor pinned
   open by echo (bleed holding avg above the close threshold), capping
   any runaway. Inert with badges in separate rooms; set
   `channel_floor_release_ms = 0` to disable. Gate log gains a
   `floor-muted K` counter. SDK env mirrors:
   `SDK_CHANNEL_FLOOR_RELEASE_MS`, `SDK_CHANNEL_FLOOR_MAX_S`.
   **Bench status 2026-07-19: NOT yet sufficient at defaults** — see
   "Adjacent-badge feedback (open)" in the pending items.

**Verdict (Captain 2026-07-17):** "very much improved… clean at distance"
(with the two badges physically separated so no acoustic coupling), some
residual choppiness that further twiddling should smooth out.

**On duplex.** The Phase 4 architecture was — and mechanically still is —
full duplex: two `_pump_audio` threads run concurrently and both
directions can carry audio at the same instant. That worked from Phase 4
on when the badges weren't within earshot of each other. What broke down
was the acoustic case: a badge speaker playing peer audio at close range
leaks into its own mic, gets amplified through `channel_gain` and
re-transmitted, and the peer hears themselves as static after every
sentence. The clean fix for that is acoustic echo cancellation (adaptive
filter subtracting the downlink from the uplink) — out of scope for a
Python-in-userspace stack. Half-duplex mute (`channel_half_duplex_ms`,
default 800) is the pragmatic alternative: while the local speaker was
recently played on, the local mic is silenced structurally, so no
feedback path exists. Users say "over" in canonical style. Setting
`channel_half_duplex_ms = 0` restores the full-duplex behavior for
setups where acoustic coupling isn't an issue (badges in separate
rooms, headset use, mobile-relay-to-badge etc.).

Half-duplex covers **same-badge** coupling (my speaker → my mic). It
cannot cover **cross-badge** coupling (peer's speaker → my mic), which
only exists when both badges share a room: the bleed arrives on the
*talker's* uplink, indistinguishable from speech, while the talker's
own mute never engages. Floor control (Phase 6 item 5) targets that
case — single talker, hard peer mute, and a release guard that
outlasts the round-trip so the tail echo can't re-open a gate — but at
default thresholds the bench still feeds back via the talker's own
pinned gate; see "Adjacent-badge feedback (open)" in the pending items
for the diagnostic and next steps.

### Phase 7 — TOS hardware findings ported back ✓ (2026-09-07)

The intercom traveled SDK → TOS. **This is the return trip.** TOS spent an
evening on real badges chasing "crap shoot transmission, static ping-ponging
between the badges even 15 feet apart", and the fix is two defaults, both of
which are structural findings rather than room tuning. Applied here.

| knob | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `SDK_CHANNEL_HALF_DUPLEX_MS` | 800 | **150** |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE_HOLD` | 0.8 | **0.5** |

**1. The half-duplex mute was guarding a path the hardware already guards, and
charging the reply for it.** These badges advertise `AT+BRSF=671` with bit 0
(EC/NR) set — they have their own echo canceller, and nothing in the stack
disables it. HFP puts the canceller in the headset by design, which is also why
these badges do ordinary full-duplex phone calls.

Worse, `speaker_last_audio` is refreshed on **every** emitted chunk, so `N` was
never "N ms of decay" — it was *the peer's whole transmission, plus N ms*. At
800 that tail lands precisely where an answer begins. Measured: peaks of **445
and 400** in the audio the mute discarded, against a 3-6 idle floor and speech
at 145-370. It was throwing away real speech. Engagement fell from **35% of
chunks to 7%** at 150.

**2. `CHANNEL_GATE_HOLD` is a transmit tail.** For that long after the last
word the gate is still open and still sending room noise, amplified by
`CHANNEL_GAIN`, out of the peer's speaker — where it can re-open the peer's
gate. That is the ping-pong. 0.8 → 0.5 cut gate-open time from 47% to 32% and
took post-transmission static to near zero. **0.4 is the measured floor**; below
it, mid-sentence pauses get chopped.

#### The two room calibrations, and why they are shipped anyway

`SDK_CHANNEL_GATE` **40 → 50** and `SDK_CHANNEL_GAIN` **6 → 3**, matching TOS.

These two *are* room calibrations rather than findings, and the first instinct
was to leave them — calibrations do not transfer between rigs, and copying one
is a mistake this project has made before. **That reasoning was wrong here, and
the Captain caught it:**

> given that these two badges and my environment are the ONLY things ever tested
> with TOS or the SDK to my knowledge, I would think that we should apply the
> `channel_gate` and `channel_gain` as well, since at least it's a known-good
> config even if specific to my badges and my environment. Better for new users
> to start with that, than with guesses.

The old 40 and 6 were not neutral defaults — they came from **the same two
badges in the same rooms**, just an earlier and less-informed session. There is
no second rig. Choosing between two calibrations from one environment, the one
that was measured last and demonstrably held a clean channel wins.

**So: where these numbers come from, stated plainly.** Two Star Trek combadges
in one home, in relatively quiet rooms with some hum, hiss and cricket noise.
Measured bounds there: room noise max **5.6**, quietest quarter of speech
**p25 = 90**. That environment is why 50 works; a workshop, an office with HVAC,
or a badge with a hotter mic will want different numbers. **Expect to tune
these two**, and use the 5 s gate log line as the instrument.

`GATE` is calibrated against a **128 ms** averaging window, which is what this
stack naturally produces — `listener.py` uplinks with
`ffmpeg.stdout.read(4096)`, a blocking pipe read, and 4096 B at 16 kHz mono s16
*is* 128 ms. Relevant if you replace the transceiver; see the known gap below.

`GAIN` applies **after** the gate, so it sets loudness to the listener and does
nothing for quiet speech getting through. **Raise it first if the peer sounds
too quiet.**

The **ordering lesson** travels even where the numbers do not, and it is
counter-intuitive enough to be worth stating: **fix the transmit tails first,
then set the gate.** Lowering `GATE` to make quiet speech carry also makes
returning echo easier to latch, so TOS's 40 → 25 helped the Captain be heard and
fed the runaway at the same time. Once the tails were fixed there was far less
for the threshold to trip on — so TOS *raised* it to 50 and got a **more**
responsive channel.

#### ⚠ Also ported: a guard against inverted hysteresis

**`CHANNEL_GATE_CLOSE >= CHANNEL_GATE_OPEN` is an oscillator, not a gate.** It
opens at `OPEN`, and the average is already above `CLOSE`, so the hold timer
resets forever and the channel transmits continuously — room noise, amplified by
`CHANNEL_GAIN`, straight into the peer's speaker.

Not hypothetical: it shipped for an evening on TOS (2026-09-07). `CLOSE` was
pinned at 16 while `OPEN` was lowered to 10 to chase microphone sensitivity, the
pair inverted, and it was audible as continuous **static ping-pong** between the
badges. It cost a test session before the printed thresholds gave it away.

The SDK is *more* exposed than TOS was, because `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE_CLOSE` can be
pinned by env var while `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE` is tuned independently. There is now
a load-time clamp (to 40% of open, with a message saying what it did) plus a
warning when `CLOSE` falls below **8**, the floor below which measured room noise
keeps the hold timer alive. The default is left as the **auto 40%-of-`OPEN`
rule** rather than TOS's pinned 16, because the rule survives someone re-tuning
`OPEN` and a pinned number would not — that gives `CLOSE` = 20 here against
TOS's 16, a small difference in the safe direction.

⚠ Both warnings are **ASCII-only on purpose**: they run at module import, before
`__main__` reconfigures stdout to UTF-8, so a non-ASCII character in them is a
hard `UnicodeEncodeError` at startup on a cp1252 console — the default on
Windows. A warning about a misconfiguration must not itself crash the server.

#### ⚠ Known gap, not ported: the gate's averaging window is a transport artefact

`_pump_audio` averages over whatever one `recv()` returns. TOS measured **128 ms
per chunk on one relay and 17 ms on another** — a 7.5x difference in averaging
time against one shared threshold, with the short-window end running roughly
double the gate-open rate on the *same* channel. TOS fixed it with a
fixed-interval window (`channel_gate_window_ms`); the SDK has not.

If both ends of your channel run the same transceiver this is symmetric and
harmless. If they do not, your thresholds mean different things at each end, and
that is worth knowing before you tune either.

#### What none of this fixes

The **cross-badge** path — badge A's speaker into badge B's mic. Neither badge
has any reference for the other's output, so no canceller at any layer can
subtract it, and no host-side AEC (NLMS, WebRTC AEC3, PipeWire
`module-echo-cancel`) can either. Below roughly **5 feet** it runs away into
feedback. TOS's answer is proximity detection with automatic channel
termination; it is not built yet, and more suppression is not the answer.

Measured operating envelope after this change, on TOS hardware: **usable down to
5 ft**, with the nearer badge winning, and static near zero.

#### Current channel defaults — the authoritative list

⚠ **Read these, not the numbers quoted in Phases 4 and 6.** Those are accurate
records of what was true *at that phase* and several have moved since; a couple
(`GAIN` 12, `GATE` 250/400-peak) predate the switch from peak to average
magnitude entirely.

| env var | default | kind |
|---|---|---|
| `SDK_CHANNEL_GAIN` | **3** | calibration — per badge/host. Raise if the peer is too quiet |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE` | **50** | calibration — per badge/room/transport. The one to tune first |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE_CLOSE` | 40% of `GATE` (= 20) | derived; clamped if >= `GATE`, warns below 8 |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE_HOLD` | **0.5** | finding — floor is 0.4 |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE_FADE_MS` | 10 | structural |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_HALF_DUPLEX_MS` | **150** | finding — 0 is now a small step |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_FLOOR_RELEASE_MS` | 0 (disabled) | adjacent-badge use only |
| `SDK_CHANNEL_FLOOR_MAX_S` | 12 | cap on a pinned floor |

The **kind** column is what matters when you tune. A *finding* is about the
badge hardware or this code and should hold anywhere. A *calibration* is about
one quiet home with two badges — shipped because it is the only configuration
ever measured and a known-good starting point beats a guess, but it is a
starting point and not a universal default.

**As a whole this set is a tested configuration**, not an assembly of
independently-chosen numbers: two badges held a clean channel on it down to
about 5 ft. Change one at a time and watch the gate log.

## Resume Point (2026-07-17)

**ALL PHASES (1–6) COMPLETE AND ON-BADGE VALIDATED.** The SDK
implementation was validated PAN↔BOX (2026-07-05); the production port
(maincomputer/intercom.py + relay-linux/relay.py + relay-mobile) was validated
PAN↔S21 (2026-07-07, all four tests passed — see Phase 5 above); Phase 6
audio-quality tuning validated on-badge 2026-07-17. The SDK tree
(`computer.py`, `listener.py`, `aliases.conf`) remains as the minimal
reference implementation; production config lives in TOS.conf
`[intercom]`, not `sdk/aliases.conf`.

**Pending / open items (production, non-blocking):**
- **Adjacent-badge feedback (open, 2026-07-19)**: same-room bench test still
  feeds back with floor control at defaults. The suspected loophole is the
  **talker's pinned gate**: the floor holder's own last words play on the
  adjacent badge, bleed back into the *holder's* mic above the very low
  gate-close threshold (auto 16), so the gate never closes, the floor is
  never released, and the bleed is legally retransmitted until the
  `channel_floor_max_s` backstop (default 12 s — reads as "still broken").
  **Diagnostic (do first, next session)**: during a feedback episode read the
  maincomputer `channel gate:` lines — (a) if `floor-muted` is 0 on both
  pumps, floor control isn't engaging: code bug, hunt it; (b) if
  `floor-muted` climbs on one side while the howl continues, it is the
  pinned gate, and `last avg X` during the howl is the bleed level at the
  mic. **Tuning relief** (live in TOS.conf `[intercom]`, read at channel
  open, no restart): `channel_floor_max_s = 3` (cap bursts), and set
  `channel_gate_close` above the measured bleed avg (e.g. 60–100) so the
  echo lets the gate close. **Structural fix if tuning confirms case (b)**:
  a holder-side close boost — a knob multiplying the effective gate-close
  threshold only while holding the floor (direct speech inches from the
  mic is far louder than speaker bleed at arm's length; the boosted
  threshold discriminates them, the gate closes when speech actually
  stops, and the release guard kills the tail echo). Small `_pump_audio`
  change in both maincomputer/intercom.py and sdk/computer.py.
- **Badge hardware**: COMBADGE 2 (2F:60) suspected marginal even on the S21 —
  replacement badge planned. On arrival: pair, update TOS.conf `[intercom]`
  badge_* MAC key and the host's badge authorization (relay
  `authorized_badges` or the mobile app), re-run the four validation tests.
- **BOX contention**: 2F:60 roams between the S21 relay-mobile and BOX
  (both target CUBE's maincomputer since 2026-07-19 — `[host-box]`
  relay.target_ip now points at CUBE, no shared fs needed). Run only ONE
  of the two relays for that badge at a time or they contend for the
  Bluetooth connection.
- **Tuning by ear** (all live in TOS.conf, no restart): `channel_gain`,
  `channel_gate` (OPEN threshold), `channel_gate_close`,
  `channel_gate_hold_s`, `channel_gate_fade_ms`, `channel_half_duplex_ms`,
  `channel_floor_release_ms`, `channel_floor_max_s`
  (watch maincomputer "channel gate:" log lines during a channel — the
  `hd-muted K` / `floor-muted K` counters show how much audio the
  half-duplex and floor mutes are stopping), `hail_silence_s`, `hail_answer_s`, `push_volume`,
  `prime_ms_push`; `prime_ms_listening` settled at 250 on PAN (the SDK's
  own `PRIME_MS_LISTENING` settled at 160 — different chirp asset).
- **Teleprompter**: cosmetic CHANNEL indicator (deferred from the original
  Phase 5 scope; intercom works without it).
- **Mobile (pre-existing roadmap, unchanged)**: call-yield handler (first),
  Phase 4 config screen + status signaling, Phase 5 polish — see
  `relay-mobile/RELAY-MOBILE.md` "Agreed next steps".
- **Vestigial**: maincomputer's zero-byte liveness-probe log guard is dead
  code now that the mobile poll is gone (harmless); the old
  `receive_and_play_voice`-based hello priming notes in RELAY.md describe
  the pre-downlink flow (superseded sections marked in place).
- Concurrent-dictation edge (two badges in simultaneous large-vocab
  takeovers) remains unexercised — out of intercom scope.

Older outstanding items:
- On-badge retest of "captain to sick bay" → "no listing" (segment-discard fix
  is wire-tested but not yet badge-confirmed; verdict arrives only at the 10 s
  window end).
- Opportunistic: server-restart re-announce on both badges (Phase 2 leftover).
- **Answer-latency (Captain's directive: any mechanism that shortens silence
  padding after the last spoken word is worth pursuing and eliminating).**
  Status 2026-07-05:
  - ✅ (a)+(b) `prepare_hail_pcm()` (replaces `normalize_pcm`) trims leading
    AND trailing dead air (adaptive threshold max(250, ref/8), 200 ms grace)
    then percentile-normalizes, one pass. Unit-verified: 5.5 s capture →
    2.4 s delivered. Per-hail log: `audio: trimmed lead Xms tail Yms ...`.
    **Pending on-badge re-verification of answer-tap latency.**
  - ✅ (c) relay audit: post-playback path is pw-play return → ffmpeg
    terminate (≤0.5 s) → immediate profile-off. No hidden padding. The
    1000 ms `PRIME_MS_COLD` is pre-speech lead-in (front, not tail) —
    retained for cold-sink reliability; tunable on hardware if total
    occupancy still feels long.
  - ⏳ (d) apply the same rule to Phase 4 channel close-out when built.
  - ✅ (e) **hail-to-playback latency (2026-07-05):** ~5 s from last word to
    target playback decomposed as server gate (~2 s, mostly irreducible) +
    target cold start (~3 s). Added `b'W'` prewarm — sent to the target the
    instant the hail phrase matches, so the target brings SCO up *during*
    the caller's remaining speech + silence gate; on `b'v'` with a live
    warm state the relay plays via the hot path (`prime=False`, no 1 s cold
    prime). Capture poll tightened 0.5→0.2 s. `start_sco_capture()` /
    `terminate_ffmpeg()` factored out (shared by cold path + prewarm).
    Wire regression green (hail frames also visibly smaller post-trim:
    134 KB→62 KB). Expected ~2.5–3 s; **pending on-badge measurement.**
    Remaining knob if still too slow: `SDK_HAIL_SILENCE_S` (1.5 s default).

**Next: Phase 4 — channel bridge** (see phase checklist above). Design locked:
answer-tap's `b'c'` placeholder in `handle_hail`/answer-tap check becomes
`b'O'`; both tap sockets go full-duplex raw PCM; server bridges; `b'X'` +
chirp on close; Linux double-tap close needs btmon added to listener.py;
validate one-way first (feedback), then duplex from separate rooms.

Working files: `sdk/computer.py`, `sdk/listener.py`, `sdk/aliases.conf`.
Deploy ritual: server-only changes → restart CUBE `computer.sh`; listener
changes → restart PAN transceiver + re-run BOX sync then restart BOX
transceiver. Wire tests (no badges needed) exist in the session scratchpad
pattern: fake downlink (`b'h'+MAC`) + fake caller streaming SAPI TTS
resampled to 16 kHz; reusable approach documented by example in this log.

**Open investigation (2026-07-05):** on-badge channel opens but freezes —
no audio either way, taps ignored, PAN log silent after `CHANNEL OPEN`.
(Earlier attempt: answer tap ran as a NORMAL session — pending hail gone
after the first hail failed recognition; caller re-hailed, second worked.)
Diagnosis + hardening applied to `run_channel`:
1. **Blocking-write freeze:** `player.stdin.write` into a full pipe (pw-cat
   dead/stalled) blocks the whole select loop — no uplink, no taps, no
   close. Fixed: non-blocking `os.write`, frames DROPPED under backpressure
   (counted), pw-cat stderr → `sdk/log/pwcat.log`, pw-cat exit rc logged.
2. **Tap-close likely unobservable during SCO:** the badge button belongs
   to HFP call control while SCO is up (mobile Phase 3 finding applies to
   the badge itself) — a tap may emit no evdev event and instead hang up
   the SCO link. **ffmpeg EOF during a channel is now treated as the close
   gesture** (mobile-style); evdev tap kept as secondary path.
3. 5 s heartbeat (`channel: up/down/dropped KB`) + close-time counters in
   the relay log prove loop liveness and audio movement for the next test.

**Second on-badge run (2026-07-05 07:04, PAN log):** heartbeats prove the
BRIDGE WORKS — ~32 KB/s flowing BOTH directions (BOX audio was reaching
PAN). Failures isolated to: (1) `pw-cat exited rc=1` 1 s after channel open
— PAN had no player for the incoming audio; error text went to stdout,
which was DEVNULL'd. Fixed: `--media-role=communication` ('=' form matching
the known-working play_wav call), both player output streams → pwcat.log,
and an automatic `paplay --raw` fallback if pw-cat dies. (2) Taps during
SCO confirmed to emit NO evdev event AND leave SCO up on Linux — neither
close gesture can fire from the badge; channel only ended via Ctrl-C.
Added server console **`close`** command (b'X' to both relays) as the
recovery hatch + test unblock.

**Third run (2026-07-05): INTERCOM CHAT WORKING.** Two follow-ups, both
resolved same day:
- **Close gesture = DOUBLE-TAP (Captain-approved, "only option").**
  Ported the full relay's proven btmon-under-pty pattern
  (`stdbuf -oL btmon`, match `AT+BVRA=1`; relay-linux/relay.py
  `monitor_bluetooth_logs`) into `run_channel` — the pty master fd folds
  straight into the channel's select loop; spawned per channel, killed at
  close. Single-tap evdev path kept as a silent secondary.
- **Idle static (serious):** CHANNEL_GAIN (12×) was amplifying the SCO mic
  noise floor continuously. Added a **noise gate** in `_pump_audio`:
  chunks below `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE` (default 400 peak) are sent as true
  silence (stream stays fed — no underruns), 0.4 s hangover protects word
  tails, and gain now applies only to speech that passed the gate.
  **Pending on-badge re-verification of both.**

**Fourth run findings + fixes (2026-07-05):** intercom chat WORKING (via the
paplay fallback). (1) pwcat.log proved this pipewire's `pw-cat` rejects raw
stdin (`sndfile: Format not recognised`) — **paplay promoted to primary
player**, pw-cat demoted to fallback. (2) PAN double-tap missed: btmon
floods the pty during SCO and the single 1 KB read per loop pass fell
behind — btmon fd now **drained to would-block (≤64 KB) per pass**. BOX
double-tap worked (close via peer's b'X' confirmed end-to-end). (3)
Residual idle static: gate switched from peak to **average magnitude**
(default 250, `SDK_CHANNEL_GATE`), with a 5 s server log line
(`gate: open n/N chunks, last avg …`) as the tuning instrument.
(4) BOX badge quieter than PAN: root cause found at the ALSA layer — BOX's
card MASTER was at 40% (alsamixer), raised to 100% by Captain, resolved.
(`pactl get-sink-volume` on the bluez sink only works while SCO is up —
"No such entity" when idle is normal.) (5) Hail-vs-channel loudness
asymmetry explained: hails played via `play_wav` at hardcoded 0.5 volume
while the channel's paplay plays at 1.0. Fixed: `play_wav`/`play_wav_cold`
take a volume param; pushed voice (hails, warm + cold paths) now plays at
`SDK_PUSH_VOLUME` (default 1.0, matching the channel); chirps and tap-cycle
TTS keep 0.5.
Supporting fixes same day: relay logging (print shadow → timestamped,
MAC/host-tagged, teed to `sdk/log/*.log`; PAN's readable from CUBE);
`RECORD_MAX_S` 10→13 s (server verdict always beats relay deadline — kills
the misleading "no/unknown signal byte: None").

## Log

- **2026-07-04** — Bench validated (PAN+BOX+CUBE). Fixed voice-response RST
  truncation (server drain-before-close + relay SHUT_WR). Fixed "computer
  time" TTS phrasing (military time). SAPI voice hinted Female (Zira).
  Phase 1 implemented: handshake, threading, registry.
- **2026-07-04** — Phase 1 validated on-air (simultaneous independent
  sessions). Phase 2 implemented: persistent downlink, keepalives,
  reconnect-with-announce, cold-SCO pushed playback, server console
  (`badges` / `hail`). Wire-level push test passed; on-badge validation
  pending. Note: with output redirected on Windows, Python's cp1252 default
  can't print the `→` banner arrows — launch with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`
  if computer.py is ever run with piped output (interactive MSYS2 terminals
  are unaffected).
- **2026-07-04** — Phase 2 validated on-badge (console hail played on idle
  COMBADGE 2). Phase 3 implemented and wire-tested (both scenarios); alias
  seed per Captain: drop "knepfler", name-first ordering. Answer-tap
  detection built early with a Phase 3 placeholder ack (`b'c'` + "X
  acknowledges.") so the full hail loop is exercisable before the channel
  exists.
- **2026-07-04** — Hail loudness fix #2: peak normalization was a no-op
  on-badge — SCO captures carry near-full-scale transients (link pops, tap
  clicks) that make the absolute peak look loud while speech stays at ~5%
  FS. `normalize_pcm()` now references the **99.5th-percentile magnitude**
  (spikes clip instead of defeating the gain) and logs
  `ref/peak/gain` per hail for on-badge tuning. Unit-verified: 5% speech +
  full-scale spike → 18x gain (was 1.0x).
- **2026-07-19** — Better log lock handling: no SDK component holds a log
  file open anymore. `listener.py` no longer hands the channel player a
  persistently open `pwcat.log` handle — player stdout+stderr now go to a
  pipe drained by a daemon pump thread that opens/appends/closes
  `log/pwcat.log` per line. A log handle held open by (or passed to) a
  long-lived process can keep the file locked — on some platforms and
  network filesystems exclusively — blocking every other reader (tail,
  grep, monitoring) for the process's entire lifetime. Every log write
  now opens, appends, and closes immediately; the `log()` writers in
  `listener.py`/`transceiver.py` already did so and are unchanged.
- **2026-07-17** — Phase 6 audio quality tuning: hysteretic noise gate
  (dual threshold + hold + boundary fade) replaces single-threshold
  flap; half-duplex mute (`channel_half_duplex_ms`, default 800)
  suppresses uplink while local speaker is playing peer audio, breaking
  the speaker-into-mic feedback path structurally; `channel_gate`
  default 250 → 40, `channel_gain` 12 → 6. New knobs
  `channel_gate_close`, `channel_gate_hold_s`, `channel_gate_fade_ms`,
  `channel_half_duplex_ms`; gate log now includes `hd-muted K`. Ported
  to `maincomputer/intercom.py` + `TOS.conf` same day so SDK reference
  and production stay in sync. Full duplex remains available
  (`channel_half_duplex_ms = 0`) for setups without acoustic coupling —
  the default just makes the same-room case sound right without
  requiring adaptive AEC.
